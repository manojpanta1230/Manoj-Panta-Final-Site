    <p>Machinery companies come in forms as varied as the equipment they manufacture.<br>
      Just as equipment prices range from thousands to millions of dollars, companies<br>
      vary from large business conglomerates to highly specialized niche companies. <br>
      What most have in common is that they generate substantial value from after-sales<br>
      services.There is no one strategy for machinery companies to generate value from <br>
      services. The best way to create and maximize value varies according to equipment<br>
      characteristics, competitive environment, and regulatory conditions. Some companies<br>
      extract most of their service value from selling spare parts. Others focus on maintenance<br>
      or diversify into the processes for which their machinery is used. Every day, machinery <br>
      companies are extending their service portfolios with more innovative and customer-oriented<br>
